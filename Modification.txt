1. Install icon
3. Give the option of fixed position of a dock in side screen top left a not at the corner.
5. a proper keyboard as well but in different design not like a keyboard, so anyone can far easily click on it without coming close enough and recommendation as proper mobile keyboard works
. like emojis and alphabet but numpad still has it priority to show.
6. 

### new thinking, 

1. Make it lively, like it's talking to you. Like a iphone top black screen. 

### better 

1. make a smart docker which changes it's functionality with respect to the use

such as if i had to fill a pin code of numbers, it becomes numpad, if i'm filling a password or something it becomes keyboard, 
if i'm playing video on youtube or anywhere, it becomes a player, 
if i'm calling from anywhere, whatsapp teams, it shows it's functionality.
